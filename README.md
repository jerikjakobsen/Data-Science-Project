Model Question:How many days will it take a property to sell on trulia?

## Motivation
In the past few years, with the increase in inflation, interest rates, and a greater number of homes for sale, for many individuals and families, it has been quite difficult to become a homeowner. 

It is only until recently that the market has finally shown some signs of recovery, to prices that can be more affordable for potential buyers, with even more hope for the future.

Given these circumstances, our purpose is to provide insight for sellers to see how long it takes to sell their properties on Trulia, a medium for real estate.

## The Works
For this project we researched datasets relating to the trulia listing and properties. We then cleaned up the datasets and merged them to be able to create a machine learning model that can predict how long it would take for a property listing to sell on trulia.
